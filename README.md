## Portfolio Management: Backtest portfolio strategies using multiple factor model

#### Tools used: Python
This project aims to compute and backtest portfolio strategies using 4 industry characteristics: market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, momentum, market beta and idiosyncratic volatility. We assess the performance of these strategies using the Sharpe Ratio and the alphas derived from the Fama-French three-factor, four-factor, and five-factor models
